# onesignal_example

Demonstrates how to use the onesignal plugin.

# iOS

First you may need to run `pod install` in the ios folder.
Then launch a simulator then you can run `flutter run`.

# Android

Make sure you have the Android SDK cli tools and have accepted the license agreements.
E.g.

```
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

Then launch an Android emulator e.g.

```
flutter emulators --launch Medium_Phone_API_35;
```

And then you can run `flutter run`.

If you are using an older Flutter or Android Studio version, you may see an error about `ndkVersion`. Follow the instructions to update the version in `build.gradle.kts`.
